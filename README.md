frequency-flashlight-ios
========================

A flashlight using an iPhones LED strobing at a given frequency

Unlike other strobe light apps, I want to create an app that uses a specific frequency in Hz.


The source code for the original strobe light app was taken from: http://www.vellios.com/istrobe/


I'm trying to adapt this source code to my needs.
